<div><strong>Mission Statement</strong><br />We will faithfully serve to hear and obey God's call for a Pastor for St. Paul's Baptist Church. We are striving to be obedient to God's will.<br /></div>
<div><strong><br /><br />Applicants<br /></strong>
<p>On behalf of the Pastoral Search Committee of St.&nbsp;Paul's&nbsp;Baptist Church the search for a new pastor for our congregation is an act of spiritual discernment.&nbsp; We covet your prayers in this process. </p>
<p>To assist us in our process of discernment, we have sought the guidance and support of our denominational leaders in the American Baptist Churches of Pennsylvania and Delaware.&nbsp; All of the applicants who wish to be considered to become our new pastor must have an American Baptist Profile (resume).</p>
<p>If you do not have a profile created with the American Baptists, you will need to contact the American Baptist Churches USA denominational offices in Valley Forge, PA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please telephone Cindy Beard, American Baptist Personnel Services at 1-800-222-3872, Extension 2488.</p>
<p>You will also need to contact the Reverend Dr. Frank Frischkorn, Executive Regional Pastor for the American Baptist Churches of Pennsylvania and Delaware (ABCOPAD), through his secretary at 1-800-358-6999.&nbsp;Dr. Frischkorn will need to sponsor you into the ABPS system.</p>
</div>
<p>Thank you again for your interest and we look forward to considering all of those who have completed profiles.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Pastoral Search Committee</p><br />
<p><strong>Scripture</strong> <br />And we know that in all things Gods works for the good of those who love Him and who have been called according to His purpose.<br /></p>
