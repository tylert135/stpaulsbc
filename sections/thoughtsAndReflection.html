</p><p>
St. Paul's Baptist Church would like to thank all who attended Installation Sunday Service.
It was truly a blessed day! The Reverend Dr. Marjorie Duncan Reed is now officially the fifth 
Pastor of St. Paul's Baptist Church.The spirit at St. Paul's was very alive. Those that were unable to attend
really missed a memorable event.
</p><p>
Thanks everyone for making this day so special. We
are all on this journey together. It's not always an easy one but it's the one
we have to walk right now. Let's do it well and let's keep the faith that we
are discovering anew. We believe God is Still Speaking. This is our reason to
have hope!</p><p>
<br />
Faithfully,
St. Paul's Baptist Church</p>
