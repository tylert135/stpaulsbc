<p>
	St. Paul's Baptist Church was organized because of need. Many African
	American families relocated to Conshohocken, Pennsylvania from South
	Carolina to find employment at the Alan Wood Steel Company. At that
	time, there was not an African American Baptist Church in Conshohocken
	where they could worship. <br />
	<br />Reverend Marshall W. Lee, a licensed minister, met with these
	newly relocated African American families. Reverend Lee, who lived in
	Conshohocken, also desired to worship locally. He was a member of
	Siloam Baptist Church, Norristown, Pennsylvania. After much
	encouragement from a local businessman, Walter Woods, he decided to
	work with these families to establish an African American Baptist
	Church in Conshohocken.

	Several organizational meetings were held in the James Hall Mill
	located in West Conshohocken. On the first Sunday in April 1925,
	Reverend Lee invited Mrs. Demmie Milton, Mrs. Mattie Smith, Mr. Walter
	Woods and Mr. Stephen Soloman to meet with Siloam Baptist Church
	located in Norristown. The meeting was held to procure letters for the
	purpose of organizing a Baptist Church in Conshohocken. <br />
	<br />On April 29, 1925, the St. Paul's Baptist Church was founded. In
	March 1926, St. Paul's Baptist Church became incorporated under
	Pennsylvania Law. <br />
	<br />The main structure of the building was erected in 1927 by
	forty-five (45) dedicated members. The stone for the church was donated
	by the Alan Wood Steel Company, Conshohocken. In 1950, the first annex
	where the organ now resides was completed. In 1955, the parsonage was
	purchased. Stained glass windows were donated by members in 1961. An
	addition was built in 1967 which joined the church school and
	parsonage. In 1981, the sanctuary was renovated and a balcony erected
	in the rear of the church. <br />
	<br />Reverend Marshall W. Lee served as pastor for more than 51
	years. Reverend James A. Groves, Sr., served as an assistant to
	Reverend Lee. <br />
	<br />After receiving a call to the ministry, Reverend Groves was
	ordained and installed as our second pastor in 1977. He served
	faithfully until his sudden passing in 1997. <br />
	<br />On June 22, 1997, Reverend Leon Lowery, an associate pastor of
	the church, was installed as the third pastor. He served for seven
	years. <br />
	<br />Reverend Mryna E. Graham, an associate minister of the church, was
	ordained in 2004 and served as the acting pastor until her retirement in May 2010.
	<br><br>Reverend Walter Johnson served as the guest minister until May 2014.<br><br>

	Reverend Dr. Marjorie Duncan Reed was installed as the 
	fourth pastor of St. Paul's Baptist Church on Sunday, May 18, 2014.<br />
