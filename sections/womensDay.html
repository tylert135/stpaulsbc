	<p>We would like to Thank God first and foremost for allowing us to
		have such a wonderful Women's Day at St. Paul&#39;s. Our Women's Day was
		truly a wonderful and blessed time. The theme for our Women's Day was
		&#34;Changed; Walking In The Newness of Life&#34; - Romans 6:4. Rev. Priscilla
		Joppy from Love Connection Ministry, brought forth the word in our
		first service. 
		</p>
		
		<p>		
		Rev. Joppy preached about "Walking in the newness of
		life". The key points were: 
		</p><p>(1) Live as a new creation. 
		<br>(2) Live under new instructions - God's Instructions. 
		<br>(3) Stand firm on His promises.
		<br>(4) Give God a new praise. 
		</p>
		<p>
		After the powerful message and upon conclusion of our first service, we went upstairs in the social hall
		to fellowship together. We enjoyed the dinner and refreshments served
		by the fine men of St. Paul&#39;s, as well as bask in the company of our
		guests. 
		</p>
		<p>
		We started our afternoon services with Praise and Worship
		conducted by Minister Monica Robinson from Siloam Baptist Church.
		There was an overflow in our pulpit, Pastor Reed and our guest
		preacher Rev. Roane from 48th Street Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church were
		joined by several other Ministers from a variety of different
		churches. Before Rev. Roane preached we were blessed with a wonderful
		musical selection "Change," from Sister Manning and the Women's Day
		Choir. It was a great way to transition into the word. Rev. Roane
		preached about "Changed". She delivered a powerful message. The key points were: 
		</p><p>(1) There is change around us, in us and through us. 
		<br>(2) Through transformation in our hearts we must hold our heads high and bear fruit according to
		Galatians 5:22. 
		<br>(3) Operate from our position in Christ. 
		</p>
		<p>
		On behalf of Sister Annie James, and
		myself (Me&#180;Lisa Morgan), we would really like to truly thank all of
		the members of St. Paul&#39;s. We would also like to thank both of our guest
		preachers, Rev. Joppy and Rev. Roane for bringing the word of God. We
		would like to thank all of our friends, and family members who came
		and joined us for service. We would like to thank everyone who served
		on a committee, and fulfilled their duty on behalf of St. Paul&#39;s. We would
		like to thank everyone who participated in service. As Pastor Reed has
		been teaching us, it’s all about HIM.
