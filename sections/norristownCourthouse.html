								On Monday, August 22, 2016 The Coalition of Montgomery County Pennsylvania Branches of the 
								NAACP met on the steps of Montgomery County Courthouse.  The Coalition is seeking 
								collaboration with Montgomery County Police departments (Ambler, Cheltenham, Main Line, 
								Norristown, Pottstown and Willow Grove) to address the causes of the divide between police 
								and the communities that they serve.  We are committed to working together to improve 
								relationships between our police departments and the communities that they serve.
