<p><strong>Church (Finance) Meeting<br />12/5/2011</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" class="MsoNormal">A congregational
meeting was held on Monday, December 5, 2011. The primary focus of the
meeting was to provide a financial summary of the past year and a budget
proposal for the upcoming year, 2012. This was a very informative meeting
in that it has been quite some time since a finance meeting was
conducted. That being said, it was not without some concerns.&nbsp;The
discussion moved a bit and centered on committees and
organizational hierarchy.Other issues discussed was the process of
submitting a proposal and vouchers for 2012 events and programs
supported by St. Pauls Baptist Church. Budget proposals for the year
2012 are to be submitted by the end of February 2012 for review and
approval by church leadership. Forms have been added to the website for
ministries to submit. The meeting closed with a prayer.</p>
