		St. Paul’s Baptist Church came out to the Montgomery County Community
		College on Wednesday, 8/13, to learn more about the Back on Track
		Program. After listening to Montgomery County Chief Public Defender
		Keir Bradford-Grey passionately speak at our church, many members were
		eager to learn more! In attendance were Pastor Marjorie Duncan Reed,
		Sister Me’Lisa Morgan, Sister Shirley Fields, Sister Olivia Fields,
		Brother Anthony Todd, Sister Janine Barr, Deaconess Marva Moore Ford,
		and Dr. Jean Wilson. 
		
		<br/><br/>The event began at 5 o’clock with some
		social time and light refreshments. After some sweet treats, it was
		time to learn more about the Back on Track Program. Ms. Keir
		Bradford-Grey began by introducing the program and talking a little
		about her passion behind getting the kids in our community back on
		track. 
		
		<br/><br/>Following her introduction, various other speakers were eager
		to share just how wonderful this program has been and will continue to
		be in the years to come. We learned a little about the history of the
		Big Brothers Big Sisters Program and how its model is being used as
		part of the Back on Track Program. We were even able to listen to some
		success stories from mentors (“Bigs”) who have been involved with the
		program for years! It was a joy to see what a great impact mentoring
		children who have been processed through the juvenile justice system
		can have on both the mentors’ and children’s lives. After many
		powerful speeches and an explanation of the expectations of the
		program, the audience was asked to become a “Big” to further help our
		community. Being a “Big” requires a one-on-one mentoring relationship
		and quality time spent with a child who would benefit from having
		someone stable and positive in their lives. 
		
		<br/><br/>The <em>Back on Track Program</em>
		is looking for more volunteers to serve as positive role models in
		order to help delinquent youth in our community. Sister Me’Lisa Morgan
		and Sister Olivia Fields have decided to join the program!! If you are
		interested in learning more about the Back on Track Program and/or
		becoming a “Big,” please see Sister Olivia Fields for more
		information.
