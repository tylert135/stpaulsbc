	    <strong>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST</strong> 
		<p>		
		We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God manifested in the flesh, 
		true God and true man. We believe in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, 
		in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, 
		in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, 
		and in His personal return in power and glory.
		</p>
		
		<br><strong>THE SCRIPTURES</strong>
		<p>		
			We believe the Bible to be the inspired Word of God, inerrant in the original 
			writings, the complete revelation of God's will for man and the final authority 
			for Christian faith and conduct.
		</p>
			
		<br><strong>THE ONE TRUE GOD</strong>
		<p>
			We believe in one God, the Creator of all things, eternally existing in three persons: 
			Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, who are co-equal and infinitely perfect.
		</p>
