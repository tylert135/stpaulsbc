							Women's Tea</h2>
 
								On Saturday, September 17, 2016, St. Paul's hosted a Women's Day Tea!
								Women from various churches attended the tea wearing their best hats and 
								dress clothes. Our key verse came from Psalm 34:1 "I will bless the Lord at 
								all times. His praise will continually be in my mouth". Sister Paula Harris was 
								our guest speaker, and did a phenomenal job sharing what it means to worship, 
								praise, and pray. Sister Lauren and Sister Lindsay Thomas used their angelic
								voices to praise and worship our Lord during the tea. Tea sandwiches and other 
								goodies were served, as well as hot tea served in real tea cups! Each woman was 
								given a charge to read a scripture each day and to record a reflection until our 
								Women's Day service which will be held on Sunday, October 23, 2016. Lots of door 
								prizes were given to our guests and each woman received a parting gift to thank 
								them for their attendance. Praise the Lord for allowing us to have such a blessed 
								event! <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1239147976157738&set=a.1247924825280053&type=3&theater" target="_blank" style="color: blue"> More Photos</a>
