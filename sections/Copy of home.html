<h2 style="line-height: 120%;">Welcome&nbsp;from St. Paul's Baptist
	Church</h2>
Praise The Lord Everybody!<br><br>
Today was our first cancellation of service in 2015.
We praise and thank God for His goodness and mercy.  
The Lord allowed me to drive to church this morning and slide on fourth street just as I made the turn.  
Then I could not park on the hill and walk into the church; it was so slippery.  
It was so icy.  There were accidents everywhere.  But God allowed me to drive back home safely.  
We can still say that God answers prayer.  The St. Paul's church family was praying and God answered our prayers.  
Our theme this year is "It's  Praying Time."  So today, please take a little time and pray.  On this rainy, icy Sunday, count your blessings.  
We have so much to be thankful for; God has blessed us in so many ways.  
<br><br>Thank Him for food, shelter, family, friends, health, and so much more.  
Give Him glorious praise.  Don't give "the game" more excitement, laughter, high five waves, etc., than we give to Almighty God!
<br><br>See you Wednesday night at 6:00 for Prayer Meeting and Bible Study!
 
<br><br>Blessings.
<br>Pastor Marjorie Duncan Reed

		<STRONG>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST </STRONG><br />
		We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God manifested in the
		flesh, true God and true man. We believe in His virgin birth, in His
		sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death
		through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension
		to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power
		and glory.<br />
	</P><br />
	
	<P>
		<STRONG>EXPRESSIONS OF PRAISE</STRONG> <br />
		I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall
		continually be in my mouth.&nbsp; <br />My soul will make its boast
		in the Lord; The humble will hear it and rejoice.&nbsp; <br />O
		magnify the Lord with me, And let us exalt His name together.
	</P>
	<P align=right><em>Psalm 34: 1-3</em></P>
	
	<P>
		<STRONG>THE SCRIPTURES</STRONG><br />
			We believe the Bible to be the inspired Word
			of God, inerrant in the original writings, the complete revelation of
			God's will for man and the final authority for Christian faith and
			conduct.
	</P><br />

	<P>
			<STRONG>THE ONE TRUE GOD</STRONG><br />
			We believe in one God, the
			Creator of all things, eternally existing in three persons: Father,
			Son, and Holy Spirit, who are co-equal and infinitely perfect.
	</P>
